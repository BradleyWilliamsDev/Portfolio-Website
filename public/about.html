<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Game Designer, developer, and software engineer. During my studies I focused on the development side of making games.</p>

<p>During my 3 years of study I received 2 awards one for the best project throughout the entire university, 
  and the second award was for the best game created.</p>

<p>To conclude my studies I was required to do work for a company. I ended up doing mine at the software development firm BBD. 
  I was only required to be there for a week but ended up being asked to stay for longer and the time I ended up being there was 3 months.</p>
